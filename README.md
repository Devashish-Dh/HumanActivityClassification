# <p align="center"> Human Pose Recognition and Activity Classification  </p>

The project / application captures subject video using a webcam and uses an **LSTM model** to classify the **actions** performed by the subject in 1-3 sec intervals in _almost_ **real time**.

This is a project that I made during my Btech 3rd Semester to dabble in Neural Networks and AI ML. 
___

It was a fun project that taught me many things, like: 
- resolving integration problems with libraries, 
- setup of [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) for training [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) based ai models locally without cloud platforms,
- use of OpenCV 
- General Software Development management and planning ( had to change the stack once because of lack of support in third party libs )
